# wechat-debian
This project is created to transplant UOS's wechat to debian.

### Testing platform
* Debian10 and Debian11
* i3WM and cinnamon  

### Update
#### 2021/02/03
I delete the dependence package debian-edu-config, and lsb-release will be generated automatically when you install this package.  
In theory, this can solve the problem of [Issue1](https://github.com/UOS-HELLO/wechat-debian/issues/1). Maybe this will allow the package to be installed in a Debian based distribution(like Mint) rather than just in Debian.

### Bugs
I don't find any bugs in the testing platform. No matter it is logging in or fcitx, there is no problem.

### Copyright Notice
This project refers to the idea of [wechat-uos in AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wechat-uos/).

This project respects the copyright of the original software package. And being created only for technical communication.
